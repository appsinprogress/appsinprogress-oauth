# appsinprogress-oauth

This repo contains the source for the [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that powers the GitHub OAuth flow and issue creation for AppsInProgress's [Penmark CMS](https://github.com/appsinprogress/penmark). (I'm hosting projects on Cloudflare but I initially rewrote this to Azure Functions https://github.com/appsinprogress/penmark-oauth).

It's a fork of [utteranc.es](https://github.com/utterance/utterances-oauth).
